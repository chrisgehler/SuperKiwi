            Although the information here is still relevant, it is also very limited simply because
            it cannot list all FAQ\'s, known issues and bugs. For more helpful and in-depth support,
            its recommended to read the XDA thread.

            This is a Xposed module application which hooks on the ANZ GoMoney, Semble
            and TVNZ OnDemand to bypass certain root detection so users that have rooted and/or
            non-supported devices can use GoMoney Wallet, Semble services and watch OnDemand videos
            respectively.

            As a rooted user I suspect you knew the risks. A disclaimer is placed on the XDA thread
            and Xposed Repository module page confirming that by using this application that
            I, ANZ, Semble, TVNZ and their partners will not be responsible for any worst case
            scenarios. To avoid bricking, do a full (nandroid) backup just in case anything
            happens. The likelihood of something happening is very slim, but don\'t
            take unnecessary chances.

            USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

            RootCloak rarely works for banking applications as the source code used is too generic
            to target all applications. In this specific case, RootCloak doesn't work properly
            with Semble or ANZ GoMoney NZ hence why this application was created.
        </item>

            I have no intention of doing that. If you are truly paranoid, the source code is
            available on GitHub which can be viewed on the main menu of this module. There you can see
            for yourself that there is no code storing bank information or sending it off to a remote
            server or anything like that.

            If an option is disabled it means the application used for those tweaks is not
            installed. For instance, if I dont have any of the variants of Semble (either from
            Vodafone, 2Degrees of Spark), the option is disabled because it would provide no
            additional benefits of having it enabled.

            This changes the way your device appears to ANZ GoMoney or the Semble application. You only need
            this enabled if your mobile phone is not on the ANZ GoMoney Wallet or Semble compatibility list but
            know your device has NFC with HCE support. This feature does not guarantee that NFC payment will
            work because there are some devices out there that simply will never work due
            to software or hardware restrictions.
            \n\n
            The difference between this and other spoofing applications is this module does NOT modify
            \'build.prop\' so it will only affect the ANZ GoMoney and Semble application, not
            the entire system which would be impractical.
            \n\n
            If spoofing is enabled for ANZ GoMoney, you MUST clear all cache and data of the ANZ GoMoney
            application and re-login. So keep your Account Number and password handy. This is not
            necessary for Semble though.

            There are several reasons why the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was chosen as the display device for the
            spoofing feature. Firstly, its on the ANZ GoMoney Wallet and Semble compatibility list.
            Secondly, I own a Note 3 so I can confirm that GoMoney Wallet and Semble work completely on
            this device and it easy to get information out of a device you already own. Thirdly, as
            previously stated, it works completely. Other devices, such as the newer S6 and S5
            range have issues even for people without rooted devices making them not an
            ideal candidate to use as the display device.

            Depending on the issue, I might not always be the best person to contact. Semble and
            ANZ GoMoney Wallet are realtively new applications and still have bugs which is
            something out of my hands. If you have a payment issue, most likely contact the
            application provider or your bank for support. If you are having root detection problem
            or the module is not working then its best to contact me via XDA or email.

            Cool! Im happy to help to answer more questions and help individuals. If you are
            experiencing a problem, please tell me a full description of problem otherwise
            I can\'t determine how to solve the problem. You can contact me via XDA or email.
            You can also contact me for feature requests as well.

            For the most part, many of the upcoming updates will be for UI improvements, bug fixes,
            or adding new features. Other times, its because ANZ, Semble and TVNZ improve their
            root detection techniques so I have to find new workarounds in order for this module to
            work with newer application versions.

        <item>When toggling features for ANZ GoMoney, why do you always state I need to clear the cache and data of the ANZ GoMoney?</item>
</string-array>

    <string-array name="helpAnswers_ANZ">
        <item>
            There is two reasons I tell you to do this. Firstly, the ANZ GoMoney Application has
            checks for root on boot as well as when you launch the application. When it detects
            root access, it disables all GoMoney Wallet features even if it was previously enabled.
            To re-activate these settings, the only way to do this is to reset application
            completely by clearing the cache and data. Another reason, which mainly
            applies mainly to the "Spoof Device" feature is that the application needs to be reset as
            device registration only happens on first-time run of the application hence why
            clearing cache and data is needed.
            \n\n
            When toggling the option to enable screenshots, you do not need to clear the data or cache.
            Next time you open the application, the setting you choose will be in place.
