            This is a Xposed application which hooks on the ANZ GoMoney to bypass
            certain checks the application does so we can use rooted and non-supported devices
            with GoMoney Wallet (NFC Payment).

            Theoretically yes, the code should work but in reality is another question all together.
            Since I do not go out shopping everyday or each time I modify this app, I rely on the
            theory that it will work. I also only have one NFC-enabled rooted device so
            my testing in the real world is also very limited. You as the end-user of this
            application, are also a beta tester. I would like to hear your experience with this
            application, whether it worked or not. Everyone\'s feedback is vital to me.

            Tough. As a rooted user I suspect you knew the risks. I placed a disclaimer that when
            GoMoney Wallet is enabled, nor I or ANZ will be responsible for any worst case
            scenarios. To avoid bricking, do a full backup just in case anything happens.
            USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

            You don\'t actually need this enabled. You only need to spoof your device if your
            mobile phone is not on the ANZ GoMoney Compatibility List. Also this does not guarantee
            that NFC payment will work. There are some devices out there that simply will never work
            due to software or hardware restrictions. Furthermore, this app does NOT modify
            \'build.prop\' so it will only affect the ANZ GoMoney application, not the entire
            system which would be impractical.
            \n\n
            If spoofing is enabled, you MUST clear all cache and data of the ANZ GoMoney
            application and relogin. So keep your Account Number and password on hand.

            Then Root detection (and device spoofing if enabled) is disabled. This may mean that
            GoMoney Wallet (NFC Payment) will be deactivated. You\'ll have to wait till Xposed
            Installer tells you that the xposed module needs updating. You\'ll need to
            follow the instructions below..
            \n\n
            1. Update the xposed module via Xposed Installer (Should be already enabled, but check just incase)\n
            2. Restart Device\n
            3. Open the ANZ New Zealand GoMoney Mods UI Application\n
            4. Enable the features you like\n
            5. Restart Device\n
            6. Open GoMoney app, check if your changes are in effect (like if GoMoney Wallet appears in the settings). If they are then your\'re done, If not, then jump to step 7.\n
            7. Clear all data and cache of the ANZ GoMoney app\n
            8. Restart Device\n
            9. Login to the application for the first time (Account Number and password required)\n
            10. Done!

            I tried it and it didn\'t work for me. But if it works for you thats great.

            I have no intention of doing that. If you are truly paranoid, the sourcecode is
            released which can be viewed on the main menu of this module. There you can see for
            yourself that there is no code storing bank information.

            No. I think the application of the ANZ GoMoney Australia application is different from
            the New Zealand one. Therefore dont expect compatibility even after Australia gets NFC
            Mobile Payment features but there MIGHT be a chance. AND STOP CLAIMING THE PAVLOVA
            IS YOURS!!!
