            This is a Xposed application which hooks on the ANZ GoMoney and/or Semble to bypass
            certain root checks the application does so we can use rooted and non-supported devices
            with GoMoney Wallet or Semble Services respectively.

            As a rooted user I suspect you knew the risks. I placed a disclaimer within this
            application that states I, ANZ or Semble and their partners will not be responsible
            for any worst case scenarios. To avoid bricking, do a full (nandroid) backup just in
            case anything happens. The likelihood of something happening is very slim, but don\'t
            take unnecessary chances.

            USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

            RootCloak rarely works for banking applications as the source code used is too generic
            to target all applications hence why it doesn\'t work for Semble or ANZ GoMoney hence
            why this application was created.

            I have no intention of doing that. If you are truly paranoid, the source code is on
            GitHub which can be viewed on the main menu of this module. There you can see for
            yourself that there is no code storing bank information.

            If an option is disabled it means that either ANZ GoMoney NZ or any variant of Semble
            is not installed depending on which option is disabled. For instance, if I dont have
            any of the variants of Semble (either from Vodafone, 2Degrees of Spark), the option
            is disabled because it would provide no additional benefits of having it enabled.

            This changes the way your device appears to ANZ GoMoney application. You only need
            this enabled if your mobile phone is not on the ANZ GoMoney Compatibility List but
            know it has NFC with HCE support. Also this does not guarantee that NFC payment will
            work as this is a Beta feature but also because there are some devices out there that
            simply will never work due to software or hardware restrictions. Furthermore, this app
            does NOT modify \'build.prop\' so it will only affect the ANZ GoMoney application, not
            the entire system which would be impractical.
            \n\n
            If spoofing is enabled, you MUST clear all cache and data of the ANZ GoMoney
            application and re-login. So keep your Account Number and password on hand.

            Any ANZ Tweaks will be is disabled (to avoid application glitches) and will result in
            GoMoney Wallet (NFC Payment) to be deactivated. You\'ll have to wait till I update the
            Xposed module to support any newer versions of ANZ GoMoney applications. When an update
            is present#8230;
            \n\n
            1. Download the lastest version of the module, and enable it within Xposed Installer and restart your device.
            2. Open the SuperKiwi Application (Has to be opened at least once to save settings)\n
            3. Enable the tweaks you like and exit application.\n
            4. Restart Device.\n
            5. Clear all data and cache of the ANZ GoMoney application.\n
            6. Login to the ANZ GoMoney application (Account Number and password required).\n
            7. Done! If everything is working, no "Root detected" messages should appear and you
            should be able to enable GoMoney Wallet as the option is visible.

            No. I think the ANZ GoMoney Australia application is different from the New Zealand
            version therefore don\'t expect compatibility even after Australia gets NFC Mobile
            Payment features. AND STOP CLAIMING THE PAVLOVA IS YOURS!!!
